#### Key Strategies:

#### Trend Up
   - **Option Type:** Put
   - **Deviation from 200ma:** +4
   - **Price Multiplier:** 0.97
   - **Expiration Date Round:** 9

   **Explanation:** Identifies stocks with a current price 4 units higher than their 200-day Moving Average, suggesting an upward trend.

   **Trade Example:** If a stock's 200-day MA is 300, the algorithm would identify potential trades if the current price is 304 or higher.

#### Trend Sideways
   - **Option Type:** Put
   - **Deviation:** Â±1
   - **Price Multiplier:** 0.98
   - **Expiration Date Round:** 14

   **Explanation:** Looks for stocks with a relatively small deviation from the 200-day MA, signaling a sideways trend. The algorithm considers both slight upward and downward deviations.

   **Trade Example:** If a stock's 200-day MA is 250, the algorithm would identify potential trades if the current price is between 249 and 251.

#### Dip Buy
   - **Option Type:** Put
   - **Deviation from 200ma:** -2
   - **Price Multiplier:** 0.987
   - **Expiration Date Round:** 8

   **Explanation:** Focuses on buying during dips. A deviation of -2 from the 200-day MA implies the algorithm is seeking stocks with prices 2 units lower than the average, anticipating a potential rebound.

   **Trade Example:** If a stock's 200-day MA is 180, the algorithm would identify potential trades if the current price is 178 or lower.

#### Over Extended
   - **Option Type:** Call
   - **Deviation from 200ma:** +2 - +10
   - **Price Multiplier:** 1.019
   - **Expiration Date Round:** 9

   **Explanation:** For the "Over Extended" strategy, a deviation of 10 from the 200-day MA indicates the algorithm is seeking stocks with a current price 10 units higher than their 200-day MA, suggesting a potentially over-extended trend.

   **Trade Example:** If a stock's 200-day MA is 400, the algorithm would identify potential trades if the current price is 410 or higher.
